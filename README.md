Sayeh creates passwords using special words

A project for entertainment :)

The Sayeh creates a password list in six different sizes based on the names you give it as input.
You can create a specific password list for an organization.

Password list for online bruteforce such as SSH and SMB.
Password list to crack by GPU as their number increases.
Sayeh does not combine your input words.

Considers all uppercase and lowercase letters.
Depending on the size of the password list, it uses special characters.

Sayeh is a Persian word & Means shadow.

My programmer friends, if part of my code is beginner I apologize.
